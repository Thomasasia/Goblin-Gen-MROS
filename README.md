This is a simple website to generate goblin characters for the tabletop RPG [Many Rats On Sticks aka GLOG v2](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2019/10/osr-glog-based-homebrew-v2-many-rats-on.html).

It will generate the stats for a levl 1 character, as goblins are particuarly likely to die during a gaming session. This website greatly expidites the process.

It also generates a randomly generated name using generated syllables and a few other gobliny rules. 

There is a button to regenerate the name, but not the stats. This is because you are not meant to reroll stats (though you can do so anyway by refreshing the page).
